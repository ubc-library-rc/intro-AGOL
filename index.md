# Visualizing Data in ArcGIS Online

## OUTLINE

### **Goals**
This workshop introduces complete beginners to the [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html) platform and tools. This workshop is intended for those unfamiliar with GIS software or code but who want to be able to create a map, add their own data, and configure a Story Map. By the end of this workshop participants will be able to:

  - Discover and explore available geospatial data online
  - Add data to a map
  - Symbolize data
  - Configure pop-ups
  - Embed a map in a Story Map
  - Add photos and text to a Story Map

  *Please be aware that this workshop uses data about deaths due to COVID-19 to explore these learning objectives, a subject which might be difficult for some people.

### **Workshop Outline**

- Create three web maps using ArcGIS Online
- Add data from the [Living Atlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/home/) and explore this dataset
- Add data from ArcGIS Online and customize using different symbology
- Create a story map using your web maps
