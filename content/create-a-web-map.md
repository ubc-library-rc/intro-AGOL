## CREATE A WEB MAP
A web map, simply put, is an interactive map. Esri's online platform, called ArcGIS Online, provides an easy way to create a web map. If you haven't done so already, sign into the ArcGIS Online (AGOL) public account you created before.

To Do
{: .label .label-green }
From the ribbon at the top of the page, click on the Map tab. ![Map tab](..master/homeRibbon.jpg)

This will open a new map.

You will see that the map is pre-populated with a basemap showing a topographic view of the world and that it comes with built in functionality. Let’s explore some of the things you can do with the map without any modifications.

*1*{: .circle .circle-blue} In the upper left portion of the map are several interactive icons. The + and – symbols allow you to zoom in and out, and you can click and drag with your mouse to move the map around.

*2*{: .circle .circle-blue} If you want to zoom in to a particular location, hold down the Shift key and then drag your mouse around the area you are interested in.

*3*{: .circle .circle-blue} The house icon in the upper left returns the screen to the same extent as it was when you opened it. If you zoom in to a different area and save this map, the next time you open it, it will open at the extent that it was when you saved it.

The location icon![The location icon](../master/locationButton.jpg) in the upper left uses your location to zoom to where you are on the map, unless it is unable to track your location. 

*4*{: .circle .circle-blue} You can also search by address or place in the search bar in the upper right. Try searching for the University of British Columbia.

*5*{: .circle .circle-blue} From the upper toolbar, play around with the different tools to see how they work.

*6*{: .circle .circle-blue} The Measure tool allows you to select a unit and measure a route you create by clicking in the map.

*7*{: .circle .circle-blue} You can also create bookmarks using the Bookmarks tool by bookmarking different locations and saving your map.

Next we’ll try adding data to the map using different methods.
