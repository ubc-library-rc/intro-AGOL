## CREATE A WEB MAP
A web map, simply put, is an interactive map. Esri's online platform, called ArcGIS Online, provides an easy way to create a web map. If you haven't done so already, sign into the ArcGIS Online (AGOL) public account you created before. 

From the ribbon at the top of the page, click on the Map tab. ![Map tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fiddleHeads/intro-AGOL/master/homeRibbon.jpg)

This will open a new map.

You will see that the map is pre-populated with a basemap showing a topographic view of the world and that it comes with built in functionality. Let’s explore some of the things you can do with the map without any modifications.

In the upper left portion of the map are several interactive icons. The + and – symbols allow you to zoom in and out, and you can click and drag with your mouse to move the map around. 

If you want to zoom in to a particular location, hold down the Shift key and then drag your mouse arount the area you are interested in. 
The house icon in the upper left returns the screen to the same extent as it was when you opened it. If you zoom in to a different area and save this map, the next time you open it, it will open at the extent that it was when you saved it.

The location icon![The location icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fiddleHeads/intro-AGOL/master/locationButton.jpg) in the upper left uses your location to zoom to where you are on the map, unless it is unable to track your location. 

You can also search by address or place in the search bar in the upper right. Try searching for the University of British Columbia.

From the upper toolbar, play around with the different tools to see how they work. 

You can find directions by typing in an address or by clicking the map to drop a pin.

The Measure tool allows you to select a unit and measure a route you create by clicking in the map.

You can also create bookmarks using the Bookmarks tool by bookmarking different locations and saving your map.

Next we’ll try adding data to the map using different methods.
