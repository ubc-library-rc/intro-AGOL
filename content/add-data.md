## ADD DATA FROM LIVING ATLAS

To Do
{: .label .label-green }
On the ribbon on the left, click the **Add** dropdown arrow and select **Browse Living Atlas Layers**.

The [Living Atlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/) is a large collection of geographic information compiled and created by [Esri.](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)

*1*{: .circle .circle-blue} In the search bar, type “COVID-19 Canada” to see what layers may be available. Click on “Coronavirus COVID-19 Cases V2.” An information dialogue will open with information about this layer.

*Note: If you only have a public ArcGIS account, you will have access to fewer layers in the Living Atlas.*

*2*{: .circle .circle-blue} Scroll down to read about it. This layer is created and maintained by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at the Johns Hopkins University, which is also maintaining the well known [Dashboard](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) tracking COVID-19 cases and deaths across the world. This layer contains the same underlying data feeding that dashboard.

*3*{: .circle .circle-blue} Click **Add to Map**, then click the back arrow above the **Add Data** search bar to return to the **Contents** pane.

*4*{: .circle .circle-blue} If your extent is still showing the University of British Columbia campus, zoom out using the scroll on your mouse or by clicking the  minus button in the upper left until you see the single red circle representing British Columbia. If you'd like, you can zoom out to show the extent of the data for the entire world.

You may notice that the data for Canada is less detailed than the data for the United States. Whereas in Canada, data is only reported at the province level in this dataset, in the U.S. it is reported at the state and county level.

*5*{: .circle .circle-blue} Click on **Content** in the upper left to see the different layers currently in the map.

Next, we'll experiment with changing the basemap.
