## CHANGE THE BASEMAP

The **Topographic** layer represents the default basemap whenever you open a web map in AGOL. Let's change the basemap to something that looks better with the COVID-19 data.

To Do
{: .label .label-green }
From the left sidebar, click on **Basemap** and select the **Light Gray Canvas**.

*1*{: .circle .circle-blue} Click on the **Save and open>Save** text in the left sidebar which should have a blue dot next to it, prompting you to save your map.

You will need to give the map a title, add tags to make it discoverable later, and a summary.

*2*{: .circle .circle-blue} Call your map **COVID-19 Cases**

Add these tags: COVID-19, Canada

Summary: Map created as part of Intro to AGOL workshop.

Next let's explore different ways of discovering the underlying data.
