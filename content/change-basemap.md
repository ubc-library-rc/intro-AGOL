## CHANGE THE BASEMAP

Whenever you open a new map in ArcGIS Online, it will open with a default **Topographic** basemap. It's easy to choose other basemaps depending on what kind of map you are trying to make. We want to choose one that is a better colour fit for the data we'll be working with.

To Do
{: .label .label-green }
From the left sidebar, click on **Basemap** and select **Light Gray Canvas**.

*1*{: .circle .circle-blue} Click on the **Save and open>Save** text in the left sidebar which should have a blue dot next to it, prompting you to save your map.

You will need to give the map a title, add tags to make it discoverable later, and a summary.

*2*{: .circle .circle-blue} Call your map **COVID-19 Cases**

Add these tags: COVID-19, Canada

Summary: Map created as part of Intro to AGOL workshop.

Next weâ€™ll try adding data to the map using different methods.
