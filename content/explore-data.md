You'll notice that there are three entries for British Columbia with the same information.

In the **Layers** pane, there are four layers associated with the data we added from the Living Atlas.

*1*{: .circle .circle-blue} Hover over each layer next to the ellipsis on the right and click the eye symbol to hide every layer except the one representing **Deaths**. You'll see that this layer is depicted using the symbol of a black X.

*2*{: .circle .circle-blue} Click on the **Deaths** layer, and you'll notice the properties of this layer appear in another pane on the right side of the map. From this pane, you could also select another layer from the dropdown arrow at the top to view its properties.

*3*{: .circle .circle-blue} From the **Layers** pane, click the ellipsis (the three horizontal dots) next to the **Deaths** layer to expand the options available.

*4*{: .circle .circle-blue} Click on **Show table** to open the attribute table for this layer.. The table, which contains the underlying data in spreadsheet form, will open at the bottom of your screen. You can click on the up arrow at the top right of the table to see more rows at one time.

*5*{: .circle .circle-blue} Click on the first row in the table and then click the three grey lines in the upper right of the table and select **Center on Selection**.
Then click **Clear Selection**.

*6*{: .circle .circle-blue} Next, from the same place, select **Filter**. This will open a window where you can customize an expression to select only the records you specify.

Let's filter the data in order to find those places in the world that have surpassed 10,000 deaths from COVID-19.

*7*{: .circle .circle-blue} From the dropdown arrow on the left, select the **Deaths** field.

From the dropdown arrow in the centre, select **is greater than**.

In the far right field, type in **10000**.

Then click **APPLY FILTER AND ZOOM TO**.

Close the attribute table.

You may notice that the black X symbolizing the **Deaths** layer is very hard to see. In the next section, we will change the symbology of this layer to make it more visible.
