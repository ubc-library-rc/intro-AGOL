## CREATE A STORY MAP

Some of you have probably already seen examples of [Story Maps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-storymaps/stories).

Anyone with an ArcGIS Online account can create one, and they are a good way to tell a story with maps, pictures, videos, and text.

They can be used as a presentation tool in place of PowerPoint, especially if you want to incorporate maps or embedded interactive content.

### Examples of Story Maps

- [Chloropleth Map](https://arcg.is/15Xffe)
  - This uses a Map Journal template and is actually a story map all about choloropleth maps
- [The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln](https://arcg.is/1LSaGu)
  - This uses a Map Tour template
- [Devastation in Nepal: Katmandu Before and After the April 2015 Earthquake](https://arcg.is/1zvCaX)
  - This story map uses Map Series and Swipe story map templates
- [The GIS community responds to the COVID-19 crisis](https://arcg.is/1qfqiD)
  - This represents the latest template that we will use today which resembles a scrolling website

In this section, we'll add the web maps we created to a Story Map and practice adding other content as well.

First uncheck all the layers except **Coronavirus COVID-19 Cases V2 - Deaths Proportional** in your map and save it.

There are a couple different ways to create a Story Map.

To start from scratch, go to [Story Maps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) and click on **New Story.**

For this workshop, we'll use a different method.

To Do 
{: .label .label-green }
From the top left of your web map, click on the **Home** dropdown arrow and select **Content.**

*1*{: .circle .circle-blue} Click on the web map you created and just exited.

This will take you to the **Overview** page.

*2*{: .circle .circle-blue} On the far right, from the **Create Web App** dropdown, select **StoryMaps.**

This will take you to a template with your web map already embedded.

*3*{: .circle .circle-blue} Add a title and subtitle. You can copy and paste the text below to use.

**Title**: Mapping Coronavirus Deaths

**Subtitle**: Visualizing COVID-19 Deaths in ArcGIS Online

Scrolling down, you'll see your interactive web map. The popups will work as you configured them.

Let's add some context before the web map.

*4*{: .circle .circle-blue} Above the web map, click on the + sign to see the options.

*5*{: .circle .circle-blue} Choose to add an **Image**, use the **Link** option and past the following URL: https://ginsberg.umich.edu/files/gb/field/image/covid-19_C.jpg

*6*{: .circle .circle-blue} Choose to add a **Heading.**

You might ask a question in the heading, such as **Did you know that pets are a barrier to leaving an abusive relationship?**

*7*{: .circle .circle-blue} Add text above the map by clicking on the plus sign and selecting **Text**.
For each paragraph, click on the plus sign and copy and paste the text in the paragraphs below.

*On June 16, 2020, the news site The Conversation published an article about one of the barriers preventing people from leaving abusive relationships: pets. The article states that some people may be more reluctant to leave an abusive relationship if they are unable to take their pet with them or are worried for its safety if they leave it home with the abuser.*

*Geographic data on intimate partner violence (IPV) shelters is difficult to find because making their locations known to the public would also make their locations knowable to abusers.*

*Evidence in the United States suggests that there is lack of sufficient housing in IPV shelters and also that for some women, homelessness intersects with domestic violence.*

*Assuming that homeless shelters are one place domestic abuse survivors sometimes access for safe harbor, we mapped which homeless shelters in Vancouver allow people to bring their pets.*

*8*{: .circle .circle-blue} Click the plus sign again and select **Image**.
Use this URL to add this infographic about the relationship between domestic violence and pets.

*9*{: .circle .circle-blue} Scroll beneath the web map, click the plus sign, and select **Embed**. Note that if you have a public ArcGIS Online account, this functionality may not be available.

[Census Mapper](https://censusmapper.ca/) is a great resource for accessing official Census maps showcasing their data as well as maps created by users.

For our story map, we'll use Census Mapper's [Low Income Explorer](https://censusmapper.ca/maps/844) to embed in our story map.

Unfortunately, this doesn't embed the map itself, just a link to the map, but it adds some nice context to our story.

Other relevant Census mapper maps include this [Dissemination Area Mapping of Household Income](https://censusmapper.ca/maps/1563#14/49.2783/-123.1140) and this [2016 Median Household Income](https://censusmapper.ca/maps/884), both of which use 2016 Canada Census data.

If you have more time, you can experiment with adding more content to your story map. 

For example, you can do a Google Image search to find images to add.

You can change the style of your Story Map in a certain section by choosing to add a different template.

You can also change some aspects of the design of your Story Map by clicking the **Design** button at the top right of the page.

*10*{: .circle .circle-blue} When you're done configuring your Story Map, click on **Preview** to see what it will look like outside of edit mode.

*11*{: .circle .circle-blue} By clicking **Publish**, you can choose to share your Story Map with your organization if your Esri account is linked to one or with the public.

Your story map should end up looking something like this [one](https://arcg.is/0qWneL).

Esri recently started promoting this style of the Story Map we have been experimenting with here.

Their older styles, called Classic Story Maps, offer different functionality and in some cases, more map-centric Story Maps.

If you are interested in checking out other possibilities, you can tour the Classic Story Map [gallery](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/gallery/#s=0&md=storymaps-apps:map-tour).
